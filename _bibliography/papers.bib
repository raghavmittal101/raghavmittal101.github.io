abstract="Walking in a Virtual Environment is a bounded task. It is challenging for a subject to navigate a large virtual environment designed in a limited physical space. External hardware support may be required to achieve such an act in a concise physical area without compromising navigation and virtual scene rendering quality. This paper proposes an algorithmic approach to let a subject navigate a limitless virtual environment within a limited physical space with no additional external hardware support apart from the regular Head-Mounted-Device (HMD) itself. As part of our work, we developed a Virtual Art Gallery as a use-case to validate our algorithm. We conducted a simple user-study to gather feedback from the participants to evaluate the ease of locomotion of the application. The results showed that our algorithm could generate limitless paths of our use-case under predefined conditions and can be extended to other use-cases.",

abstract = {Locomotion in a virtual environment within a limited physical space is a complex activity. There exist established techniques to support limitless natural walking in virtual environments. These include Redirected walking, Dynamic path generation, and Walk-In-place technique, etc. PragPal is one such limitless path generation technique that supports natural walking in virtual environments. It is a novel software-based non-haptic locomotion technique. In this paper, we detail the enhancements to the existing PragPal path generation technique that addresses underlying issues in the technique like (1) path collision at angular turns, (2) effective usage of the physical play area, and (3) the ability to set path-width during path turns.},
